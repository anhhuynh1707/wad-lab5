- Pagination

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Struggling with the .jstl since the new version of Tomcat, so I need to use the Jakarta JSTL 3.0 instead of JSTL 1.2.
- Taking more time to understand how the Servlet works based on the MVC model (request, response).
- Giving the wrong value of filter and sort. Therefore, I cannot see the filtered results by major.

EXTRA FEATURES:
- Implementing CSS for search, filter, and sort functions.
